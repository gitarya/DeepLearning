<h3>Initialization初始化</h3>
In this file I use three different intialization methods to test the train accuracy: zeros initialization, large random initialization and He initialization. And it turns out He initialization perform well.

<h3>Regularization正则化</h3>
In this project I try two different method of regularization to reduce variance. One method is L2 Regularization and another is dropout.

<h3>Optimization Methods优化算法</h3>
This project include optimization methods like mini-batch gradient descent, momentum and Adam algorithm.

<h3>Tensorflow Example/Tensorflow示例</h3>
Basic grammar of Tensorflow. This example calculate the derivative of a formula.
Tensorflow的基本语法，利用tensorflow求二元一次方程的导数。

<h3>Tensorflow Deeplearning Network使用Tensorflow实现深度学习网络</h3>
Implement a deep learning models by using Tensorflow. This model can achieve multiple classification of data sets. The optimization algorithm is Adam.
利用Tensorflow实现了一个深度学习模型，可以实现图片数据集的多元分类，优化算法使用的是Adam算法。
