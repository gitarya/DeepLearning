<h3>Initialization</h3>
In this file I use three different intialization methods to test the train accuracy: zeros initialization, large random initialization and He initialization. And it turns out He initialization perform well.

<h3>Regularization</h3>
In this project I try two different method of regularization to reduce variance. One method is L2 Regularization and another is dropout.

<h3>Optimization methods</h3>
This project include optimization methods like mini-batch gradient descent, momentum and Adam algorithm.
